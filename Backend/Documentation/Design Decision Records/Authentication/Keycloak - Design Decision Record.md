## Title
Implementing Keycloak for Unified Authentication in the SaaS Factory

## Date
2025-09-26

## Status
Approved

## Context
The goal is to implement authentication for multiple applications within the SaaS factory to avoid repetitive setup. A centralized authentication mechanism is needed to streamline user management across all future projects.

## Decision
We have decided to use Keycloak as the authentication server. Keycloak is an open-source solution with extensive documentation and is recommended by Microsoft. This choice ensures that we have full control over the authentication system and avoids ongoing costs associated with hosted services.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Auth0** – Rejected because it is a paid service, and we prefer an open-source solution.
2. **Other options** – We are aware of other authentication systems, but for now, we have chosen Keycloak.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Centralized authentication for all future applications.
- Full control over the authentication mechanism.
- No ongoing subscription costs.

**Negative:**
- As a self-hosted solution, it requires us to manage reliability and uptime, unlike cloud-hosted services.
- Potential future migration if we need more advanced features.

## Additional Notes / References
- Keycloak documentation and resources are available for future reference.
