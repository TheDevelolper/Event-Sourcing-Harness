## 👤 Creating User Accounts

If you need to set up an account for development. 

> A default developer account should already exist when you start the app.
>
> You can login with the following credentials:
> **User**: developer@developer.com
> **Password**: developer

If you really need to create a new account manually you can do so like this:

1. Head over to the Users in the left hand pane and click the "create new user" button.

2. Ignoring the other options, simply add an email address for the user with a first name and last name then click the button labelled "create".

3. Click the tab labelled "credentials" and then the "Set password" button. 

4. Ensure that the temporary option is unchecked, then add a password and click save.

When you go back to the UI you will now be able to login to your development account.
