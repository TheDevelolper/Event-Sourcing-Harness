# 🎨 Theme Color Usage Guide

When designing your UI with a theme, it’s important to assign colors consistent roles. This ensures clarity, hierarchy, and accessibility. Here’s a suggested mapping:

- **💎 Primary** – The main brand action; the thing you want users to do most.  
  *Examples:* Call-to-action (CTA) buttons like **“Sign Up”**, **“Submit”**, **“Save”**.

- **⚡ Secondary** – Less critical or supporting actions.  
  *Examples:* Secondary buttons like **“Cancel”**, **“Learn More”**.

- **✨ Accent** – Decorative highlights or subtle emphasis.  
  *Examples:* Tags, badges, links, small highlights.

- **❌ Danger** – Actions with negative consequences.  
  *Examples:* Delete buttons, destructive actions, error alerts.

- **✅ Success** – Positive feedback or confirmation.  
  *Examples:* Success messages, “Completed” badges.

- **⚠️ Warning** – Cautionary or attention-needed feedback.  
  *Examples:* Warnings, “Unsaved changes” notices.

**💡 Tips:**
- Your **CTA** should almost always use the **primary color** to stand out.  
- Secondary and accent colors are supportive — they should **not compete visually** with primary.  
- Semantic colors like **danger, success, and warning** are independent of primary/secondary and help communicate intent clearly.
